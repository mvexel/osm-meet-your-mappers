                <h2>Help</h2>
                <p>The steps to get your list of mappers are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <!-- <li>Log in with your OpenStreetMap account. You can <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new" target="_blank">create one</a> if you do not have one.</li> -->
                    <li>Zoom and pan the map to the area you are interested in.</li>
                    <li>Click <code>Draw Rectangle</code> to put the map in drawing mode.</li>
                    <li>Click and drag to create a box.</li>
                    <li>Click <code>Meet Your Mappers!</code>.</li>
                    <li>After a short while, a list of active mappers in the area will appear.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At the bottom of the list, you will find an <code>Export to CSV</code> button. This lets you
                        download the list as a CSV file that you can use in other programs.</li>
                    <li>If the list is very long and you are looking for a particular mapper, you can start typing their
                        username in the text box that says <code>Filter by username</code></li>
                    <li>We go back one year to get active mappers in the area you selected.</li>
                    <li>Only boxes are supported at this time. If your box is too big, we will tell you. You can start
                        over with a smaller box. The maximum width and height allowed is 1 degree. The larger the box,
                        the longer it takes to retrieve the list</li>
                    <li>You can sort the list by clicking on the headers.</li>
                    <li>Only the top 100 mappers with the most changes in your area will be displayed. If you download
                        the CSV, all mappers will be included.</li>
                    <li>The website loads new data from OSM in the background, so we are always up-to-date!</li>
                    <li>Please use this website only for personal or OSM volunteer community purposes.</li>
