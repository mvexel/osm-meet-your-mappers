## [1.0.7] - 2025-02-27

### Added
- **Threaded Backfill:**  
  Introduced multi-threaded backfill scripts with improved error handling, retry logic (including exponential backoff), and a database connection pool for more robust concurrency.
- **CSV Export Function:**  
  A dedicated `exportToCsv()` function is now used with a single click listener, preventing multiple export dialogs from being triggered inadvertently.

### Changed
- **Table Sorting Logic:**  
  Removed external TableSort dependency in favor of a custom DOM-based sorting mechanism, which streamlines dependencies and simplifies maintenance.
- **Enhanced Network Resilience:**  
  Updated the replication file download logic to handle SSL/connection errors with specific retries and exponential backoff.
- **API & JS Refactoring:**  
  Aligned front-end JavaScript with API changes due to the new `tags`, `comments` (JSON), and `bbox` columns. Improved date parsing and display in `script.js`.
- **Docker & DB Configuration:**
  - Removed the external port mapping for PostgreSQL (`5432` no longer exposed on the host).
  - Expanded environment variables and Docker Compose settings for advanced Postgres usage and improved backfill scripts.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate CSV Exports:**  
  Addressed an issue where multiple CSV export event listeners were attached, causing duplicate export dialogs.
- **Date Parsing:**  
  Enhanced error handling around invalid date strings when parsing changeset data, reducing runtime exceptions.
- **Connection Stability:**  
  Created new sessions to avoid SSL and connection reuse issues, stabilizing concurrent downloads and database writes.

### Removed
- **TableSort Scripts & Styles:**  
  Deleted `tablesort.js`, `tablesort.css`, and associated references, replaced with a custom sorting solution.

### Dependency Updates
- **asyncpg** upgraded from `0.29.0` to `0.30.0`.
- **psycopg2-binary** upgraded from `2.9.9` to `2.9.10`.
